## 📌 Overview

This repository presents a structured design for an end-to-end real estate analytics pipeline.

The project focuses on how property-level data can be logically linked with market-level indicators to support valuation, return analysis, and scoring validation.

Rather than implementing a production system, this repository documents **data models, processing logic, and validation workflows** that demonstrate analytical and system-design thinking.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Define clean and normalized data schemas for real estate entities
- Design normalization and ROI feature logic
- Outline ingestion, cleaning, and valuation workflows
- Establish quality control, logging, and orchestration strategies
- Validate scoring outputs across the full pipeline

## 🧩 Tasks Breakdown

The project is organized into the following tasks:

- **Task A** – Define Data Schemas for Property/Market Linkage
- **Task B** – Design Normalization Logic and ROI Features
- **Task C** – Develop Data Ingestion Modules
- **Task D** – Implement Data Cleaning and Standardization
- **Task E** – Develop Valuation Model Pipelines
- **Task F** – Logging and Quality Control Framework
- **Task G** – Pipeline Orchestration and Scheduling
- **Task H** – End-to-End Validation of Scoring Outputs

Each task builds on the previous one to represent a complete analytical pipeline.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each task is maintained in a dedicated folder containing:

- 📄 A detailed Word/PDF document describing the task logic, assumptions, and design
- 📝 A short README summarizing the task objective

This structure allows reviewers to easily navigate and review each task independently.

## 🧠 Design Notes

- The schemas and workflows are based on **standard real estate domain concepts** and **representative datasets**commonly used in property analytics
- The emphasis is on **clarity, consistency, and analytical readiness**, not on production deployment or live model training
- All assumptions and logic are documented to ensure transparency and traceability
